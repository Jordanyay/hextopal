# Hextopal

### What? What is this?
Hextopal is a Bash script born from the inconvenience experienced from going back and forth from GIMP just to get specific color codes for desktop/application theming... Yes, seriously.

### What's up with the project name?
"Hextopal" is a concatenation of the original project name "hex-to-palette", which makes the project more memorable and interesting sounding compared to the former. Thanks to my accent, I pronounce the name of this project as "hecks-toe-pull", but please feel free to pronounce it however you'd like.
